# 🔥 What you will learn
- Introducing the algorithm, dataset and various libraries used for the project.
- Understanding the data through Exploratory Data Analysis.
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- Machine learning section; predictive modelling.
- Saving and loading model as file.


## 🔢 Data Exploration summary
- Checks how sex and age affects the student's grade.
- Can student relationship status affects his/her grade.
- Is there any impact parents educational level have on students performance.
,etc
